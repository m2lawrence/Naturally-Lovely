# Naturally-Lovely
Shopping Cart website


https://www.naturallylovely.net/ 

I created a Microsoft C Sharp MVC5 EF6 website for my customer Lene, so that she can sell her handmade soap to her customers online. It has a shopping cart that is linked to her PayPal account to take payments. 

I completed a software course on www.Udemy.com to build the website from scratch.
